# Deleted

Deleted provides a slightly different experience for hard deletes. Clicking a delete button
creates a dropdown with a confirmation and cancel button. This requires two click actions from
the user, helping to prevent accidental deletions.

It's dependency-free and delightfully lightweight:

```
deleted.min.js 711 B (gzipped)
deleted.min.css 490 B (gzipped)
```

See it in action: <http://johnotander.com/deleted>.

## Installation

Via Bower:

```
bower install --save deleted
```

Via npm:

```
npm install --save deleted
```

## Usage

Link the javascript and CSS files:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <!-- ... -->
  <link rel="stylesheet" href="/path/to/deleted/css/deleted.min.css">
  <!-- ... -->
</head>
<body>
  <!-- ... -->
  <script src="/path/to/deleted/js/deleted.min.js"></script>
</body>
</html>
```

Then, you can use deleted with the following link and data attributes:

```html
<a href="/some-link/for/deletion"
   class="btn--red"
   data-deleted=true
   data-deleted-prompt="Are you sure you want to delete this?"
   data-deleted-text="Confirm"
   data-cancel-text="Cancel">
  Delete
</a>
```

#### A custom example

```html
<a href="javascript:alert('custom deleted!')"
   class="btn--red"
   data-deleted=true
   data-deleted-prompt="Look out, there be dragons."
   data-deleted-text="Go ahead, delete it"
   data-cancel-text="Nevermind">
  Custom Delete
</a>
```
